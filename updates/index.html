      	<h2>Major Assignments</h2>

      	<p>For this assignment, you were to do one of the following. Create a professional (simple) website, where you had 3-5 pages.

      	<li>Discussion #2</li>
      	<p>Given the results of the browser discussion in week 1, how do we code sites for all the different platforms? 
      	One option is to try to determine what browser is being used, but that is not an exact science. Instead, developers 
      	focus on creating "responsive" sites. What is responsive design? How is it accomplished? (in general terms) 
      	What is meant by the phrase "content is like water"?</p>
      	<li>Assignment 4 - CSS DUE SEP 18</li>
